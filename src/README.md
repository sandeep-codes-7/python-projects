# variables and user input.
''' 
As we know that, we can use variables to store the data.
A variable is an entity that stores data of different type.
Since python is a dynamic programming language, it's not necessary to declare variable's data type.

Ex:
num = 12;
name = 'Sandeep';
balance = 7.5

So, now we are aware of variables..

in C/C++ or java, you might have seen different functions or methods to take the input from the users.

But, in python we use a simple function 'input()'
The input function is assigned to a variable to store the value or data.

Ex:
name = intput()

NOTE: In python, input() function by defaults returns the string type data.
